# Eat n Split

This is a React project developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as part of '[The Ultimate React Course 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/)' by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## What I learned

In this project, I built a bill splitter to revise the fundamentals of React, also leaning to _make reusable components using children props_
